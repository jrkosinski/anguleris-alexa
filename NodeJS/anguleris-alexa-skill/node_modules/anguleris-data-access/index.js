The product's design utilizes LEDs, a digital sound card, and a direct-drive barrier system which makes for a low-maintenance but very effective lobby security solution.

It can be used as a purely optical turnstile or as a barrier-type optical turnstile. When in “barrier mode” the glass panels act as an additional visual deterrent to unauthorized access attempts. The Delta 5000-SG’s breakaway barrier type is acceptable by all safety code regulations. Method of Operation: An access card or other credential is presented to the customer supplied access control reader mounted inside the casework. If entry is authorized, the Traffic Flow Indicator (TFI) will light as a green arrow pointing in the direction authorized, the barriers will open, and a chime will sound indicating to the user that they may pass. Unauthorized access attempts and tailgaters are singled out by local visual/audible alarms and access control system event condition."
